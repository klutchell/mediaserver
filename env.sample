# If you want to have your container names resolved by netdata it needs to have access to docker group.
# To achive that just add environment variable PGID=999 to netdata container,
# where 999 is a docker group id from your host. This number can be found by running:
# grep docker /etc/group | cut -d ':' -f 3

# Provide a directory for storing service configuration locally
# This way it persists and is not lost on container update
# Subdirectories will be created automatically for each service
# Path should be absolute, or relative to docker-compose.yml
# eg. /data/config

# Provide a directory for storing temporary download files.
# This way it persists and is not lost on container update.
# Subdirectories can be created later to separate tv, movies, nzget, etc.
# Path should be absolute, or relative to docker-compose.yml.
# eg. /data/downloads
DOWNLOADS_DIR=

# Provide a directory for storing completed downloads and media.
# This way it persists and is not lost on container update.

# The users option is an array of authorized users. Each user must be declared using the name:hashed-password format.
# Note: when used in docker-compose.yml all dollar signs in the hash need to be doubled for escaping.
# To create user:password pair, it's possible to use this command:
# echo $(htpasswd -nB user) | sed -e s/\\$/\\$\\$/g
